leave a practice better than you found it

An invitation to leave the practice better than we found it...  

Gather here to kick down the door and keep it open for people who have been historically marginalized and excluded from equal access to opportunity.
Keep showing up to advance a culture of justice, acknowledge privilege, confront unconscious bias and demand safety for the most vulnerable among us.
